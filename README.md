#  📦  dockerize-node-simple

## TLDR;

A minimal node app with Dockerfile to have a basic test for my local Docker setup when I can't make it work in more complex projects! :)

### Credits:

I took most of it from this tutorial:
[Dockerizing a Node.js web app](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/nodejs-docker-webapp/)

Then I made it smaller by using "alpine" node package as suggested here: [10 best practices to containerize Node.js web applications with Docker](https://snyk.io/blog/10-best-practices-to-containerize-nodejs-web-applications-with-docker/)

This makes the Docker image go from 1GB to slightly over 100Mb. Nice.

I also added a generic node .gitignore (waaaay overkill for now but hey) 🤷🏼‍♂️

## TODO:

Maybe I will add the other best-practice node-dockerize recommendations later (same goal, see them working in a simple project, then figure out why they may not be working in a more complex project).

Cheers 🤙
